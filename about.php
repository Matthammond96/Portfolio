            <h2>About Me, From The Start Till Present Day (Draft)</h2>
            <p>So how did I become to fall in love with the world of design? It started back in 2009, when I got my first over Xbox and fell in love with video games, espically Call Of Duty. I was so imursed in this world, I would watch YouTube videos of people playing the game, this then lead me and a few friends to creating a YouTube channel. In-order for me to create the content which we uploaded. I had to learn a few programs by myself. To edit I used Sony Vegas Pro and watch video tutorials and play around with the program to understand and succesfully use the program. This was fine to use at the start however the production quailty one other channels went up, this meant to keep the viewiers and subscribes I had to adpate, I learnt Adobe After Effects combined with Cinema 4D to create cool 3D enviroment in which we edited the game into. I also learnt photoshop to allow me to keep the Team's Logo, background and thumbnails update. One year into the channel we hit 12,000 Subscribers and over 1,000,000 views, some videos would reach over 100,000 views. <br><br> However playing and video editing every day became alot espaiclly while still studying at high school. This meant I had to drop out of the team. It was hear whilst studying GCSE Graphics which I finished with an A where I found my true passion for design and the power that it can have. Even though then my design skill wasnt to good I still managed to create a cool game case and protyped a product which we created a paper protype. Unfortanly I didnt think it was important to keep this work so I dont have it in my portfolio. From here I knew that I wanted to go into design but I had no clue what sort of design that I wanted to speicallise in (More about that later). After getting my GCSE's back which was high enough to go onto doing a Level 3 course at my Local Collage, where I studied Games design. This course allowed me to full explore all aspects of design. On the course we studied 3 modeling and animation. Game Coding and Web Coding. Still design using photoshop and illustrator all the way to advertising the game.<br><br> I enjoyed all aspects of design which made the decision of what do to after collage and Univerity much harder. As I really enjoyed the marketing aspect to the course however wanted to learn more about design I went on to study Digital Media Design and one of the best Media Schools in the UK Bournemouth Unveristy. That summer before starting uni I working in Baracaloner and Salford (UK) creating the online email campaigns for that summer. This is where my true passion for designing for digital marketing was born, that summer combined with a year studying design really set the fire alight. The summer of 2015 after the first uni at university I worked two design jobs, one was to create an online platform for one of Bournemouth Unviversity Reseach team to post regular updates and on there research, unfortantly due to the breif i was limited to using WIX. Also that summer I went back to working for Markem, once again I was designing and creating the online campaigns.
